# This is the specialization course way. Code improvements are going to be implemented for already going on project
# plan. To do this the most paramount thing is that mandatory conditions should be added by applying clean code,
# understandable as well. And It might be run as quickly as possible. If It works with essential requirements, enhancement
# will be certainly benefitted by somebody as well. However someone else might rather do this project all over again.
